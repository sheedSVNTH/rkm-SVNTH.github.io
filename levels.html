        <h3>Level I - Vision</h3>
        <p>You realize there is more than what meets the eye in the world around you. You start with an idea, a goal, a dream. This dream becomes impregnated in your mind and your thoughts cannot escape as the idea grows and becomes a part of you. The journey begins as you bring your Vision to life by taking <strong>ACTION.</strong></p>

        <h3>Level II - Action</h3>
        <p>You can spend your entire life thinking of ideas or talking about doing something, but it isn’t until you dive into it that you make any chance of converting to reality.  All great entrepreneurs, athletes, artists and living legends have defined themselves with the Actions they have taken.  Action also encompasses the Spirt of Adventure.  This willingness to embrace change and think and act in a way outside of your comfort zone.  Having an open mind to try new things and seek new experiences plants a seed to your self-development. Putting your dream into motion sparks a fire inside you, your eternal flame, your <strong>PASSION.</strong></p>

        <h3>Level III - Passion</h3>
        <p>You’ve found your purpose, your desire, your passion. Nothing will stop your momentum and the only way is up – Better, Stronger, Wiser.  Your success continues to fuel your drive into an endless cycle of motivation and self-discipline.  You have found your mental portal to harness tunnel-vision focus which becomes your source for an unnatural <strong>STRENGTH.</strong></p>

        <h3>Level IV - Strength</h3>
        <p>Level Four.  You’re growing. The challenges you take on lead to mutation of savage power and super-charged energy physically, and even more important, mentally.  The way you think has changed.  You no longer let petty thought or principles guide your judgment, and you have learned the skill of emotional intelligence.  Negative outcomes, people, and emotions become your input for productive – positive energy pushing through barriers and plateaus.  You develop a new appreciation for adversity, recognizing it as an opportunity to <strong>EVOLVE.</strong></p>

        <h3>Level V - Evolve</h3>
        <p>Looking back to the beginning of your journey through the Levels, you don’t recognize who you were before you started.  You have molded your existence into a form that you previously couldn’t have even conceived in fantasy.  Transformation has manifested itself in your physique, your intellect and your way of living.  Your development through the previous levels has created an obsession with self-improvement and an endless hunger to continue to learn and grow. The foundation for building <strong>WISDOM.</strong></p>

        <h3>Level VI - Wisdom</h3>
        <p>Experience of life combined with the knowledge acquired through its tough lessons is how Wisdom is obtained.  True wisdom is not only measured by your knowledge, but by how many lives you can inspire to make a difference.  This realization bears passage to the final level, <strong>FULFILLMENT.</strong></p>

        <h3>Level VII - Fulfillment</h3>
        <p>Life isn’t easy.  There is no right or wrong, or an ultimate guide on how to live life.  All you have are your collected philosophical ideas, and strength – mental and physical to endure the ups and downs life will place in your path. It is also the journey and the things you do, people you meet, that define your life.  At this final level, you have mastered the previous virtues.  You started with a group of goals, and through dedication and perseverance, you have conquered them all. Not only are your accomplishments significant in themselves, but the small changes you have made as a person along the way.  Your whole life has been based on actions and decisions that are based around your well-being, but what changes is your realization that life isn’t about you.  You share life with family, friends, and those you inspire to live life to the fullest.  While success is important, you know it isn’t defined by money, possession or status, but by how you can use your skills to make a difference; <strong>to change the world.</strong></p>
