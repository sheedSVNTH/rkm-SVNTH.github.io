			<h3 id="blog-title">Setting Goals for the Best You and How to Achieve Them</h3>
		</div>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px">With the Holidays wrapping up as New Years Eve approaches, its that time of year where everyone makes their “New Years Resolution.”  For most of us we take this New Year “reset” as a prime time to tackle those unattainable goals, that for some reason, can't be determined or accomplished during the rest of the year. None-the-less, this year will be different.  You’re going to lose 10 pounds, learn to play violin and start a Fight Club. Okay, the last one was a joke. The point is, every year people make unrealistic goals and beat themselves up over “poor” results.  In this article, I’m going to share key essentials to setting realistic, attainable goals.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px">First, I think its important to identify critical goals for yourself, regardless of the New Year’s hype.  Below, are some categories you should consider tackling this upcoming year before the Uber-booze train takes you to the Midnight Firework Show.
			</p>
			<h4>Personal Finance</h4>
			<p>Personal finance can be a touchy subject for some, but I’ll keep it simple and to the point.</p>
			<h4>Save, Save, Save!</h4>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px">
			Saving your money is absolutely key to better yourself in all aspects.  This starts by developing good spending habits: monitor your income and expenses.  You shouldn’t expect to build a savings account without creating a budget and watching your spending.  As they say, it takes money to make money and by that your best form of money earned, is from learning to cut expenses.</p>
			<h4>Creative Funding and Debt Dodging</h4>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px">I go over this a little more in my previous blog (Financial Discipline), but, to put it quickly, find ways to generate income or exchange current expenses with another. For example, if you need a new laptop, instead of just throwing it on the debit card, try creating income through selling old stuff from your closet on E-bay. If you don’t have a creative way to generate short-term income, try exchanging a current expense for another.  Cut back on your Starbucks runs and pocket that money to save for the needed item. <br> Avoid being in debt for things you don’t need. Remember, if businesses didn’t make money off of your spending habits; buying beyond your means, than banks, insurance companies, credit agencies, would all go out of business. </p>
			<h4>Health and Fitness</h4>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px">This one should be self explanatory, but for many, proper nutrition is a struggle. Take a look at your current diet and see what you can do to improve. Are you drinking more sodas and juices than water? Are you eating too many carb sources and not enough protein for your body’s nourishment? I’m not going to start a health rant, but I want to encourage you to look at your eating habits and see what small, achievable changes you can make to start the gears in creating a better YOU.
			</p>
			<p style = "text-indent: 40px">
			On the exercise front, think about ways to be more active that will fit with your current schedule.Taking your dog out for a walk, biking to the coffee shop, joining a local gym with a friend, anything to get you moving.  If you don’t have time to dedicate to working out or some physical activity for at least 30 minutes, try doing H.I.I.T. cardio (High Intensity Interval Training).  You can find some great workouts online that are as short as 10-15 minutes.  Not only do you burn calories during the activity, your metabolism is boosted with the “after-burn” effect and operates much more efficiently.
			</p>		
			<h4>Continued Knowledge Expansion</h4>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px">With the world around us always in movement, job markets and industries changing, fast-evolving technology, it's important to stay sharp.  You should always be looking to improve yourself for the sake of being better and also increasing your self-marketing value.  Get into the habit of reading daily, or instead of watching aimless Youtube videos, find content that will improve your immediate needs (Financial, Health, Career, etc.)  There is a lot of great material out there if you are determined enough to find it. 
			</p>
			<h4>Making Your Goals Measurable</h4>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px">Amongst all the Holiday cheer and Champagne (don’t forget the Champagne), motivated more than ever before, you have committed to the most rewarding goal you have ever considered. Now here’s the most important part, and where a lot of people go wrong. They focus too much on the goal but don’t have a way to measure or monitor progress. So here’s some tips on how to actually accomplish your New Year’s Resolution:
			</p><br>
		
		<em>Choose attainable goals - </em> This means picking something you can actually strive for. Don’t say you want to lose 20 pounds if you only weigh 100 pounds.  Goals aren’t mysterious accomplishments that occur by some miracle. A goal is simply making a commitment and honoring it.<br><br>
		<em>Make your goals measurable - </em> If you have a goal to lose weight, make a determination how much to lose and by what time.  “I want to lose 10-15 pounds by July 4th, 2017” is a measurable goal rather than saying, “I want to fit into my prom dress again.”  If you go about it the right way, your desired end-result will be an outcome.<br><br>
		<em>Break down the goal - </em> It can be pretty daunting to commit and follow up with a lofty goal of losing 15 pounds by summer. However, its a lot easier to monitor and mentally accept a goal to lose half a pound a week. People fail themselves when they set a large goal and expect it to just happen.  By breaking your goal into “bite-size” pieces, you can slowly chip away with your ax of ambition. 
		
		<p>Other examples:
		<li>Instead of read 1 book / month try, read 15 minutes / day </li>
		<li>Instead of make $10,000 dollars this year, save $100/ week. </li>
		<li>Instead of exercise everyday, try exercise a min. of 3 times / week.</li>
		</p>
		
		<p>If you follow these (3) guidelines, you will be much more likely to succeed and accomplish your goals.  The great part, you can use these pointers any time of year! Good luck!  Have a safe and Happy New Year!<br>
